# Money Allocation Manager

A desktop application written in Python that helps you design and maintain a multi-level money allocation plan.  
It stores your allocations in a local SQLite database (`allocations.db`) and provides a convenient tree-based editor for creating, updating and removing buckets.

## Features

- Visualise your allocation hierarchy in a multi-column tree view.
- Create, edit and delete buckets with arbitrary nesting depth.
- Track both the share relative to the parent bucket and the cumulative share of the overall plan.
- Mark buckets as *included* or *excluded* from the aggregated roll-up percentages.
- Attach notes to every allocation for additional context.
- Import a comprehensive sample dataset or replace your data from a CSV export.
- Export the current database contents to CSV for backups or further processing.

## Getting started

The application only requires the Python standard library (Tkinter is bundled with CPython on all major platforms).

1. Ensure you are using Python 3.11 or later.
2. Install the project in editable mode or simply run the entry module directly:

```bash
python -m moneyalloc_app
```

Alternatively you can use the helper script:

```bash
python main.py
```

On first launch an empty database is created next to the Python modules. Use **File â†’ Import sample data** to load a detailed example hierarchy inspired by the plan provided in the task description.

## Working with the UI

- **Add root** creates a new top-level allocation that counts directly towards the global total.
- **Add child** creates a nested allocation under the currently selected bucket.
- **Edit** opens the selected bucket for changes. Saving updates the database immediately.
- **Delete** removes the selected bucket and all of its descendants.
- **Expand all / Collapse all** control the visibility of the hierarchy tree.
- The form on the right displays the details of the selection and exposes fields when you are adding or editing items.

The *Children share* label helps you verify that the percentages of the immediate children sum up correctly for the selected parent.

## CSV import/export format

Exports contain the following columns:

| Column | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `id` | Unique identifier of the allocation. |
| `parent_id` | Identifier of the parent allocation (empty for top-level rows). |
| `name` | Display name of the bucket. |
| `currency` | Optional currency label. |
| `target_percent` | Share of the parent bucket expressed as a percentage. |
| `include_in_rollup` | `1` if the allocation contributes to the overall totals, otherwise `0`. |
| `notes` | Free-form description or comments. |
| `sort_order` | Integer describing the order of siblings. |

When importing from CSV you must keep these columns (you can edit the values).  
The application clears the current database before inserting the imported rows.

## Database location

The database file `allocations.db` lives inside the `moneyalloc_app` package directory by default. You can back it up or version it as needed. Deleting the file will reset the app.

## Development notes

- The project intentionally avoids third-party dependencies to ease distribution.
- The default Tkinter theme is switched to `clam` when available to provide a modern appearance.
- Sample data is declared programmatically in `moneyalloc_app/sample_data.py` and can be used as a template for further customisation.
